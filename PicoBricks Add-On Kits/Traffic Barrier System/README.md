## Traffic Barrier System
PicoBricks Traffic Barrier System is a PicoBricks educational kit that allows passing when it detects an object on it thanks to the LDR sensor positioned on a wooden road. Traffic Barrier System uses the LDR sensor, RGB LED, motor driver and buzzer module from PicoBricks modules. In addition, a servo motor is included in the set to be attached to the motor driver module.



The purpose of the Traffic Barrier System set is to drive a car, etc., over the wooden road after putting the wooden parts and PicoBricks modules in the set together by following the installation steps. When you come across the LDR sensor while passing with toys, the RGB LED that lights up red turns yellow and then green. Then the traffic barrier rises into the air, the buzzer gives a warning and the barrier stays in the air until the toy passes through the barrier.
