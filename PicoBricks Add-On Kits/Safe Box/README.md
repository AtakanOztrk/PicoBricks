The smart trash bin is an entertaining kit that can be created by using wooden pieces, an HC-SR04 distance sensor, a servo motor, a motor driver and Raspberry Pi Pico. The project aims to create an electronic trash bin that opens its lid by detecting objects thanks to the HC-SR04 distance sensor in front of it.

### Modules on The Smart Fan
- Servo Motor: It is used to provide movement in mechanical projects that require angular movement. 

- Motor Driver: It is a circuit element that adjusts the speed and frequency of the circuit elements. 

- HC-SR04: It is a circuit element for detecting distance in projects that require distance measurement.
