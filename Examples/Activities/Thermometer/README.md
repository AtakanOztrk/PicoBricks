## Thermometer Project Details
Sensors are the sense organs of electronic systems. We use our skin to feel, our eyes to see, our ears to hear, our tongue to taste, and our nose to smell. There are already many sense organs (sensors) in the picobrix. Also, new ones can be added. You can interact with the environment using humidity, temperature, light and many more sensors. Picobricks can measure the ambient temperature without the need for any other environmental component. Ambient temperature is used in greenhouses, incubators, in environments used for the transport of drugs, briefly in situations where the temperature change must be constantly monitored. If you are going to do an operation on temperature change in your projects, you should know how to measure the ambient temperature. In this project, you will prepare a thermometer with Picobricks that will display the ambient temperature on the OLED screen. 

Project Details and Algorithm Picobricks has a DHT11 module. This module can sense the temperature and humidity in the environment and send data to the microcontroller. In this project, we will write the necessary codes to print the temperature values measured by the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor on the OLED screen.
