## Smart Cooler Project Details
Air conditioners are used to cool in the summer and warm up in the winter. Air conditioners adjust the degree of heating and cooling according to the temperature of the environment. While cooking the food, the ovens try to rise to the temperature value set by the user and maintain that temperature. These two electronic devices use special temperature sensors to control the temperature. In addition, temperature and humidity are measured together in greenhouses. In order to keep these two values in balance at the desired level, it is tried to provide air flow with the fan. In Picobricks, you can measure temperature and humidity separately and interact with the environment with these measurements. In this project, we will prepare a cooling system that automatically adjusts the fan speed according to the temperature with Picobricks. In this way, you will learn the DC motor operating system and motor speed adjustment. 

In our project, we will firstly display the temperature values measured by the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor on Picobricks. Then, we will define a temperature limit and write the necessary codes for the DC motor connected to Picobricks to start rotating when the temperature value from the DHT11 module reaches this limit, and for the DC motor to stop when the temperature value falls below the limit we have determined.
