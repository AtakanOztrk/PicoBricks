## Voice Controlled Robot Car Project Details
Developing and continuing to develop artificial intelligence applications recognize
human characteristics, learn and try to behave like people. We can express artificial
intelligence as software that can learn in its shortest form. Sometimes it learns the
image, sometimes the sound, and sometimes by using the data it collects from the
sensors. It does this thanks to the algorithms determined by the developers, and
it helps in the decision-making processes in the areas it is used according to the
results it has achieved. In short, artificial intelligence applications are now used in
situations where the decision-making process needs to be done quickly and without
errors. From the marketing field to the defense industry, from education to health,
from economy to entertainment, artificial intelligence increases efficiency and
reduces costs.
In this project we will do with PicoBricks, we will make a 2WD car that you can
control by talking. PicoBricks allows you to communicate wirelessly with 2 6V DC
motors and bluetooth. 

In the project, the robot car kit that comes out of the set will be assembled and
controlled via mobile phone. The HC05 bluetooth module is a module that enables
us to communicate wirelessly between PicoBricks and a mobile phone. Thanks to
the mobile application installed on the mobile phone in the project, the commands
sent from the phone will be transmitted to PicoBricks via the HC05 module and the
robot car will move according to these data. We can direct the robot car with the
forward, backward, right, left buttons from the mobile phone, as well as send data
to PicoBricks with voice command. In the project, we will give voice commands to
control the movements of the robot car.
