It is called the state of being autonomous when electronic systems make a decision based on the data they collect and perform the given task automatically. The components that enable electronic systems to collect data from their environment are called sensors. Many data such as the level of light in the environment, how many degrees the air temperature is, how many lt/min water flow rate, how loud the sound is, are collected by the sensors and transmitted to PicoBricks as electrical signals, that is data. There are many sensors in Picobricks. Knowing how to get data from sensors and how to interpret and use that data will improve project ideas like reading a book improves vocabulary. [otonom anahtar kelimesiyle ilgili bir görsel olabilir örneğin bir elektrikli otomobilin çevresiyle iletişim kurma görseli] In this project, with PicoBricks, we will enable the LED to turn on when the amount of light decreases in order to understand the working systems of the systems where the lighting is turned on automatically when it gets dark.
