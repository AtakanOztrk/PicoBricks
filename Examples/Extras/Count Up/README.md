## Count Up Project Details

With this project, you use a servo to count from 0 to 60 seconds. The arrow on the servo moves 3 degrees every second.
You could use this project to make a game clock or stopwatch. You use the button to stop the clock.
You can let it count down instead of up with a slight modification.
