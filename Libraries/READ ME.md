 MicroBlocks is a free, Scratch-like blocks programming language for learning physical computing with educational microcontroller boards such as the microbit, Adafruit Circuit Playground Express, and many others. MicroBlocks is a live environment. Click on a block and it runs immediately, right on the board. Try out commands. See and graph sensor values in real time. No more waiting for code to compile and download.
