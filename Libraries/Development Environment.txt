 - #####[Thonny (MicroPython) IDE for Beginners](http://thonny.org/ "Thonny (MicroPython) IDE for Beginners")
 At the heart of Picobricks is the Raspberry Pi Pico. The Thonny Raspberry Pi is a great choice for coding Pico and therefore Picobricks.
 - #####[Arduino IDE ](http://www.arduino.cc/en/software "Arduino IDE ")
 Picobricks offers us the opportunity to code with Arduino C. Getting started coding the Raspberry Pi Pico at the heart of Picobricks with the widely used Arduino IDE is pretty easy.
